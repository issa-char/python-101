## PYTHON 101
A comprehensive outline for a Python course that covers everything from basics to mastery. Keep in mind
achiving mastery takes time and practice, be patient as you progress through the stages.
NB: During the duration of this course, I employ Jupyter Notebook to facilitate interactive learning and simultaneous coding.

## Stage 1: Getting started with python

### week 1-2: Introduction to Python
- understand what python is and why it's popular.
- install python and set up a development environment
- write your first Python program ("Hello, world").

### week 3-4: Control strutctures and functions
- Explore conditional statements (if, else, elif).
- work with loops (for and while).
- define and call functions.
- understand scope and lifetime of variables.
