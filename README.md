## PYTHON 101
A comprehensive outline for a Python course that covers everything from basics to mastery. Keep in mind
achiving mastery takes time and practice, be patient as you progress through the stages.
NB: During the duration of this course, I employ Jupyter Notebook to facilitate interactive learning and simultaneous coding.
