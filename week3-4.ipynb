    "Conditional statements are essential for controlling the flow of your program based on certain conditions. They allow your code to respond dynamically to different inputs and conditions, making your programs more powerful and flexible. By mastering conditonal statements, you can control the flow of your code and execute specific blocks of code based on various situations.\n",
    "Conditions are expressions or statements that evaluate to either `True` or `False`. They are typically emmployed in conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`), loops (`while`, `for`) and logical operations.\n",
    "conditions can involve comparisons (`x > y`), equality checks (`name == \"Alice\"`), membership checks (`item in <list>`) or complex logical expressions (`(x > 5) and (y < 10)`)."
